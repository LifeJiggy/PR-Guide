# Code Styling and Hooks

This guide covers code styling standards and Git hooks for maintaining code quality in production environments.

## Comprehensive Walkthrough

1. **Choose Your Formatting Tools**: Select tools like Prettier, Black, or ESLint based on your programming language and team preferences.

2. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**: Install and configure pre-commit hooks using tools like husky (Node.js) or pre-commit (Python) to run checks before commits.

3. **Configure Linting Rules**: Define linting rules in your project's configuration files (.eslintrc, .pylintrc) to enforce consistent code quality.

4. **Automate Style Checks**: Integrate automated style checking into your CI/CD pipeline to catch style issues during pull requests.

5. **Create Style Guides**: Develop and document your team's coding standards, including naming conventions, indentation rules, and file organization.

6. **Use Code Formatters**: Implement automatic code formatters that can fix style issues automatically on save or before commits.

7. **Version Control Configuration**: Store formatting configurations in version control to ensure consistency across team members.

8. **Integrate with IDEs**: Configure your development environment to use the same formatting and linting tools for real-time feedback.

9. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically update your styling tools and configurations to keep up with new language features and best practices.
